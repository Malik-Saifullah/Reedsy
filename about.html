                <p>Crafting beautiful books is at the heart of everything that Reedsy does. We're changing the
                    way books are published by giving authors and publishers access to talented professionals,
                    powerful tools, and free educational content.</p>

                <p>Reedsy was founded in the summer of 2014 by Emmanuel Nataf, Ricardo Fayet, Vincent Durand and
                    Matt Cobb. Since then, we’re proud to have built a network of world-class publishing professionals
                    and helped produce over 10,000 books.</p>

                <h2>Quality, creativity and diversity</h2>

                <p>Publishers and authors trust us to provide them with quality talent. That’s why we only work with
                    editors, designers, marketers, and ghostwriters who have experience crafting books that land on the
                    New York Times bestseller list.</p>

                <p>Authors come to us from a range of backgrounds. Maintaining a diverse roster of professionals
                    ensures that authors from all walks of life can find the right people to help. This is our
                    challenge:
                    to allow you to exercise your creativity by making sure our services are perfectly suited to your
                    genre and budget.</p>

                <p>That’s why you will find that Reedsy professionals come from all across the globe: based in over
                    30 countries, they have worked with clients of all sizes and sensibilities. Our idea is simple: the
                    more perspectives we can bring to the table, the more unique the books produced on Reedsy will be.
                    We believe that in a world otherwise dominated by a mass-market culture, the need for a diversity of
                    books is greater than ever.</p>

                    <p>We’re not just building Reedsy to make money and for the occasional feature in a renowned
                        publication. After a few years building the company, it was important to us as founders to give
                        back,
                        which is why we started the <span>#IWriteBecause</span> campaign in May 2017. The campaign has
                        reached over 6.7
                        million people to date and allowed us to donate to Room to Read, a non-profit organization that
                        provides girls in Africa and Asia with access to education.</p>
